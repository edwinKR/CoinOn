# "CoinOn" Project

CoinOn is a scatter plot graph viewing the top cryptocurrencies in the market. This was a project where I developed an algorithm implementing data visualization in a three-day Hackachton for my bootcamp. The objective was to learn a new stack and I chose D3.js with React and used the CoinMarketCap API for the data.

Hover or click on one of the dots and you will be provided with the crypto's:

* name
* symbol
* price per USD
* rank
* availability of supply (%)

You can change the size of the bubbles by moving the button at the very bottom. Do it slowly to see the gradual change.
